Throughout my career, I have successfully led teams to produce high-quality, user-friendly applications. I find joy in tackling complex technical challenges and mentoring my team members to reach their full potential. My main focus is on creating elegant, high-performance, and maintainable apps that provide exceptional user experiences.\n\nI graduated from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon in November 2013. I began my career in February 2014 as an OJT and moved into a permanent full-time role in May 2014. In 2019, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, for professional training and to gain insights into Japanese work culture.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new technologies to sharpen my skills, savoring coffee, and playing games.",
